### **Colour cycle Code Simulation**
Here we can see that Red, Blue and Green are set to 1111 when they are on. When two colours are on at the same time, they
create a different colour.

## **Colour Stripes Code**
When generating the colour stripes, we add in row and coloumn to create the stripes.

### **Editing Color Stripes**
Here I have experimented with the rows, columns and colours to gain a better understanidng of how the code works.

## **Traffic Light Test**
Here i have created a very basic image which represents a traffic light, with a filter light. Setting the cloumns and rows to certain values i was able to generate small 
blocks with the appropriate colours. I decided to pick a traffic light as it serves as a good strarting point. From here i would like to simulate the ligts turning on in a 
sequence.

### **Setting Traffic Light Dimensions**
In the code below i set the dimensions of the screen into variables, and then I divide these variables in half to make the center of the trafic light in the middle of the screen.
I then adjusted the dimensions of the traffic light to make it into a suitable shape.

Centre_X and Centre_Y are the centre coordanites of the rectangle, the width and height of the traffic light are TRAFFIC_LIGHT_WIDTH and TRAFFIC_LIGHT_HEIGHT. The code uses
